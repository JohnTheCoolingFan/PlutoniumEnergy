# Plutonium Energy

## Description

This mod adds new nuclear material - Plutonium (238 and 239 isotopes). You can get it by using an advanced reprocessing process for Uranium nuclear fuel.

With the new material, you can make Plutonium-based nuclear fuel for the regular reactor or MOX fuel, which is a mix of Uranium and Plutonium. the MOX reactor is smaller and has a lower energy output alone, but has an increased neighbour bonus.

If you want to produce a lot of Plutonium, you will need to use Nuclear Breeding. It's a way to generate more Plutonium by burning a cell in a special Breeder reactor.

And with energy generation part comes along destructive part. This mod also adds plutonium ammo - cannon shells, machine gun / pistol ammo, plutonium atomic bomb, which speaking with numbers is around 1.4 times more powerful than uranium one.
And as an explosive cherry on top - the Plutonium Atomic bomb is an Artillery Shell with a very powerful explosion

#### Other mods about nuclear energy:

*   [Realistic Reactors](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RealisticReactors) - Impressing mod that makes reactors more complicated and realistic. Has support for other mods, partially Plutonium Energy. Full support from PE side is planned.
*   [RITEG](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RITEG) - Good mod that adds [RITEGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator)
*   [Realistic Reactor Glow](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RealisticReactorGlow) - Changes reactor's glow from green to more realistic cyan (Similar to how MOX reactor glows)

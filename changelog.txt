      Also significantly increased the damage and range of the Plutoinium
      atomic explosion. The recipe is a combination of both Artillery Shell
      and Atomic Bomb.
    - The MOX fuel cell as a concept has been split into two:
      Plutonium fuel cell is a fuel cell made with plutonium which can be used in a regular reactor
      MOX fuel cell is made from a combination of Pu-238 and U-238 and can be used in a MOX reactor
      MOX reactor now has a higher neighbour bonus of 150%

      Also updated colors for flow and barrells, they appear distinctly bright now.
    - Changed style of the reprocessing recipe icons for improved clarity.
  Localization:
    - Localization has been offloaded to Crowin via Factorio Mods Localization project.

    - Increased Breeder fuel cell energy value to 10GJ
    - Decreased Breeder fuel cell stack size to 5
    - Reduced breeder fuel cell output from recipes by a factor of 2.5
    - Changed breeder fuel cell recipes iron plate requirements to be 5 per
      cell instead of varying in alternative recipes
    - Increased time, resource usage and output of Breeder fuel cell
      reprocessing recipes by a factor of 2.5 except for amount of cells
    - Technology cost has been rebalanced. Notably, Nuclear breeding now requires space science.
    - Reduced cost of the MOX reactor to 200 of each ingredient.
